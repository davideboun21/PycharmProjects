MY EXPECTATIONS IN ZURI INTERSHIP PROGRAM

Knowing fully well that tech is a gold mine in the entire universe. It was this drive that brought me to join intellifora for my Industrial Training program earlier this year. Up to that point, I have been checking up videos and reading materials to give me insight about what tech is all about, its influence and its importance. My time in intellifora, however made me have a better insight of the path to choose in tech.
Being part of building an app which is still in view, I feel engaged and have a sense of enthusiasm that I could attain a great efficiency in this field. Thus, my desire to further formalize my love for tech made me join Zuri internship training. Thanks to this experience, I know now better than ever that Zuri internship will five me greater edge to be more experienced in tech.
In addition to just tech, joining Zuri internship training, my expectations are to look for initiatives even during the internship program, to improve my professional communication skills, to be vast in critical thinking, networking opportunities and I have only scratched the surface of this ever evolving field but I know that the technological potential is limitless.
Finally, I strongly expect that my participation in this internship program by Zuri would make my potential similarly limitless.
